        A girl of 11 at the series' outset, Sansa shows promise in all things expected of a "proper lady" and
        believes in tales of romance and adventure featuring honest, brave knights.
        This often leads to friction between her and her sister Arya. At the start of <i>A Game of Thrones</i>,
        she travels south to the capital with her father Eddard. As she explores more of Westeros, her naivety begins
        to shed away as she sees a grimmer side to the world.
